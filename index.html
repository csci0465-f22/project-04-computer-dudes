          <h2 style="color: white"> Plotting Mental Health by County </h2>
          <p style="color: rgb(222, 222, 222)"> 
            This choropleth graphs the number of average poor mental health days by county
            across the United States. Looking at the graph, we determined that West Virginia
            shows the highest concentration of larger values, and North Dakota seems to rank
            the best. To get even more specific, we can analyze the most extreme cases in each state: 
            Williams County (North Dakota) and McDowell County (West Virginia). We will use these counties
            as case examples to convey how social community and workplace experience define regional mental 
            health statistics. 
          </p>
          
          <p style="color: rgb(222, 222, 222)">
            To visualize these phenomenon, we're using a broad data set of sociohealth statistics 
            to analyze various quality of life metrics as they relate to mental health.

        <section>
          <h2 style="color: white"> McDowell County, WV and Williams County, ND at a Glance  </h2>
          <p style="color: rgb(222, 222, 222)"> An initial comparison of Williams 
          and McDowell County shows their similarity in many relevant 
          statistics. Many of these similarities come in metrics one may 
          initially point to for impacting mental health of an area. 
          Both areas have similar unemployment and obesity rates, as well 
          as insufficient sleep. This leaves us to focus on other metrics 
          as the cause in the discrepancy in mental health.</p>

        <p style="color: white">Seeing that nothing from obesity, 
        unemployment, or sleep stand out, notice the striking difference
        in both poverty and social community. Although social community may 
        stand out less, this is just due to the scale of the visualization. 
        In terms of ratio from one to another, Williams County dominates 
        McDowell in this statistic. So, if the residents of both counties 
        are employed at similar rates and in similar physical health, we 
        point the finger at the quality of jobs and social community of each 
        county as being the driving force in the disparity in mental health.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 style="color: white">Social Life</h2>

          <p style="color: white">Due to the extremely rural nature of
            each county, one may expect the social aspect of each to be
            similar. This however, is not the case. Residents of Williams
            County reported to have interacted with an average of 47
            people per day. Although this number may be small compared to
            the likes of a city, it dwarves the 10 observed in McDowell
            County. Additionally, we cite Dunbar's Number which claims that
            a person can maintain 150 relationships as evidence that
            interacting with 47 people daily may very well provides a
            healthy social life. This claim is backed up by the strong mental
            health seen across Williams County.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 style="color: white">Job Quality</h2>
          <p style="color: white">In addition to social life we a see an 
          impactful disparity across counties in job quality. Poverty may 
          have been a tell tale sign of this, but the disparity goes much 
          deeper that that. Beyond a higher median income, people in 
          Williams County have on average a much shorter commute to work. 
          Further, across both respective states as a whole, workers in 
          North Dakota typically have a much higher satisfaction with their 
          jobs</p>
          <p style="color: white">Putting all of this together, it comes 
          as no surprise that the county where people maintain a healthy 
          social life as well as enjoying a short commute to a well paying 
          job they love each day performs so strongly in mental health 
          measures.</p>
