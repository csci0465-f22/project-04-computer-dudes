            This choropleth graphs the number of average poor mental health days by county
            across the United States. Looking at the graph, we determined that West Virginia
            shows the highest concentration of larger values and North Dakota seems to rank
            the best. To get even more specific, we can analyze the most extreme cases in each state: 
            Williams County (North Dakota) and McDowell County (West Virginia). We will use these counties
            as case examples to convey how social community and workplace experience statistics correlate 
            with regional mental health. In terms of hard data, the average number of poor mental health days per month
            in Williams County is 3.33, compared to McDowell's 7.46.

          <p style="color: rgb(222, 222, 222)">
            To visualize these phenomenon, we're using a broad data set of sociohealth statistics 
            to analyze various quality of life metrics as they relate to mental health.

          <p style="color: rgb(222, 222, 222)"> 
            This radar chart visualizes a comparison of Williams County and McDowell County across five statistics that
            we considered potentially relevant to mental health. Looking at the grpah, we can see that both areas show
            similar rates for unemployment, insufficient sleep, and obesity, but that there are significant proportional
            differences in poverty and socialization rates.
          </p>

          <p style="color: rgb(222, 222, 222)">
            Although the social score difference may be less initially stark, this is because both percentages are numerically smaller. 
            In terms of ratio, Williams County dominates McDowell in this statistic. Given that 
            the residents of both counties are employed at similar rates and that physical health differences are nonsignificant, 
            we can point to job quality and the sociability of each community as a significant influence
            on the respective disparities in mental health.

          <p style="color: rgb(222, 222, 222)">Due to the rural nature of
            each county, one may expect the socialiability scores of each to be
            similar. This however, is not the case. Residents of Williams
            County reported that they interact with an average of 47
            people per day. And although this number may be small compared to
            the likes of a city, it dwarves the 10 observed in McDowell
            County. Additionally, we cite Dunbar's Number which claims that
            a person can maintain 150 relationships as evidence that
            interacting with 47 people daily may very well provides a
            healthy social life.</p>

          <p style="color: rgb(222, 222, 222)">
            In addition to social life variability between the counties, we a see an 
            impactful disparity in job quality. Poverty rate is a sure marker of this, 
            but we can get more specific. Beyond a higher median income, people in 
            Williams County have a much shorter (average) commute to work and workers in 
            North Dakota typically have a much higher satisfaction with their 
            jobs. Putting all of this together, it comes as no surprise that 
            the county where people maintain healthy social lives paired with less
            draining work days and higher pay performs so much more strongly in mental health 
            measures.
