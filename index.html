          <h2 style="color: white"> Mental Health Across the United States </h2>
          <p style="color: white"> Making use of a choropleth to 
          graph mental health across the United States the conclusion
        is drawn that North Dakota ranks among the highest in terms of best
      mental health while West Virginia ranks the lowest. This is 
    interesting across two states which have similar population density.
    We take Williams County of North Dakota and McDowell county of West
    Virginia as a case example to convey a story of how social community 
    and workplace experience shapes this phenomenon. </p>
          
          <p style="color: white">We use a broad data set of 
          sociohealth statistics in order to represent these rather 
          unorthodox or niche quality of life metrics.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 style="color: white"> McDowell County, WV and Williams County, ND at a Glance  </h2>
          <p style="color: white"> An initial comparison of Williams 
          Count and McDowell shows their similarity in many statistics one 
        may initially point to for impacting mental health of an area. 
        Both areas have similar unemployment rates, insufficient sleep, and
        obesity rates, leaving us to focus on other metrics.</p>

        <p style="color: white">Seeing that nothing from obesity, 
        unemployment, or sleep stand out, notice the striking difference
        in both poverty and social community. Although social community may 
        stand out less, this is just due to the scale of the visualization. 
        In terms of ratio from one to another, Williams County dominates 
        McDowell in this statistic. So, if the residents of both counties 
        are employed at similar rates and in similar physical health, we 
        point the finger at the quality of jobs and social community of each 
        county as being the driving force in the disparity in mental health.</p>

          <h2 style="color: white">Social Life</h2>

          <p style="color: white">Due to the extremely rural nature of
            each county, one may expect the social aspect of each to be
            similar. This however, is not the case. Residents of Williams
            County reported to have interacted with an average of 47
            people per day. Although this number may be small compared to
            the likes of a city, it dwarves the 10 observed in McDowell
            County. Additionally, we cite Dunbar's Number which claims that
            a person can maintain 150 relationships as evidence that
            interacting with 47 people daily may very well provides a
            healthy social life. This claim is backed up by the strong mental
            health seen across Williams County.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 style="color: white">Job Quality</h2>
          <p style="color: white">In addition to social life we a see an 
          impactful disparity across counties in job quality. Poverty may 
          have been a tell tale sign of this, but the disparity goes much 
          deeper that that. Beyond a higher median income, people in 
          Williams County have on average a much shorter commute to work. 
          Further, across both respective states as a whole, workers in 
          North Dakota typically have a much higher satisfaction with their 
          jobs. Putting all of this together, it comes as no surprise that 
          the county where people maintain a healthy social life as well as 
          enjoying a short commute to a well paying job they love each day 
          performs so strongly in mental health measures.</p>
