# About this visualization

We began by visualizing a variety of the statistics in our data sets using choropleths and a dropdown selection for which variable to display. This made it easy to compare a range of variables on a county level across the country. Much of this EDA can be found in the following Observable notebook: https://observablehq.com/d/d0722932b0d15450. We initially intended on telling a story about quality of life, but we quickly switched to comparing mental health as a proxy for quality of life which could be investigated more directly with the given mental health statistics. This came as a somewhat arbitrary choice based on our personal interest. Additionally, the data set had many variables commonly used in various quality of life indices which would be applicable to this topic. Our initial investigation did not indicated an unexpected amount of similarities across statistics we expected to cause mental health disparity in our case study states/counties. This led us to zone in on job quality and social life (which came from a data set created to assess the risk of Covid transmission around the country). This background culminated in our choice of making a scrolling visualization which first showed the mental health disparity we were investigating before subsequently claiming, with the backing of our visualizations, that social life and job quality were the culprits of this phenomenon.

We began with a choropleth which showed both mental health data for the whole county before filtering to only show North Dakota and West Virginia. This was to show the data for the whole country, justifying our choice to focus on West Virginia and North Dakota, before more directly comparing these areas. Next, we chose one county from each state to use as a case study. Each county was selected as it had either the best (in the case of North Dakota) or worst (in the case of West Virginia) mental health in the state. Using a radar chart to compare these two counties allowed us to show that the only major variance across these areas was in socialability and poverty. This allowed us to justify our claim that these statistics were the cause of the mental health disparity. This naturally continued to investigating both of these statistics specifically. We chose to show difference in number social interactions in a simple, yet aesthetically pleasing way to communicate how much more social Williams County was than McDowell. For poverty, we illustrated this using overall job quality. We again chose relatively simple visualizations which would clearly display the data we wished to show, using additional customization for both intuitive and aesthetic appeal. We were most proud of the high level of customization we gave all of our visualizations, giving high attention to every aesthetic aspect of each piece. Working with the choropleth proved difficult, and we were not able to zoom in on specific regions as we had hoped. However, we were still very pleased with how the choropleth, and all the visualizations generally, came out.
